# HO-Editor
HO-Editor (HtmlOnlineEditor) it's a very basic PHP Web App for coding in HTML using just the browser. 
It was made for the SummerCamp in [KidsCoding](http://kidscoding.com.mx/). The purpose for this web-app is to make easy for the students to 
code in HTML with no Editor installed in the PC and with the facility to store their files in the web.
You can use this project for your personal or business projects. Just remember that you have to change the Server name in the variable "host" inside 
the file **editor.php**.
